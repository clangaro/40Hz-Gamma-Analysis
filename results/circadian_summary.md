1. Overview
This report summarises the effects of 40 Hz gamma light stimulation (ISF) on circadian rhythms and spatial learning performance in mice. Analyses assessed:
Circadian Amplitude (RA)
Intradaily Variability (IV)
Interdaily Stability (IS)
Circadian Phase Shift (circular)
Barnes Maze learning rate (log-latency mixed model)
Mixed-effects models were used for circadian and behavioural outcomes, with Mouse ID as a random effect to account for repeated measures within subjects. Circular phase analysis was performed for timing variables.
The principal hypothesis tested:
Does 40 Hz gamma light stimulation alter circadian organisation or Barnes Maze learning compared with controls (CNT)?
2. Circadian Rhythm Analyses
2.1 Relative Amplitude (RA)
RA indexes the strength/robustness of the circadian oscillation.
Mixed-Effects Model Results
LightGroup (ISF vs CNT): no significant difference (p = 0.656)
PREPOST: RA was slightly higher at PRE than POST for all mice (p = 0.031)
LightGroup × PREPOST interaction: non-significant (p = 0.609)
Interpretation
40 Hz stimulation did not alter RA, either at baseline or across time.
The small PRE→POST decline in RA occurred in both groups and is unrelated to stimulation.
Age effects were strong (Young > Middle > Old), consistent with known age-related circadian decline.
2.2 Intradaily Variability (IV)
IV measures rest–activity fragmentation.
Results
LightGroup × PREPOST interaction: p ≈ 0.19 (not significant)
Interpretation
No evidence that 40 Hz stimulation reduced or increased circadian fragmentation.
2.3 Interdaily Stability (IS)
IS measures day-to-day regularity.
Results
LightGroup × PREPOST interaction: p ≈ 0.96 (strong null)
Interpretation
ISF and CNT groups show identical levels of day–day circadian stability across PRE and POST.
This is one of the clearest null results in the dataset.
3. Circular Phase-Shift Analysis
Circular PRE→POST phase shift was computed for each mouse.
Group Means
Group	Mean Phase Shift (rad)	Hours	SD (rad)	n
CNT	–0.003	–0.01 h	0.48	49
ISF	–0.056	–0.21 h	0.64	44
Mann–Whitney U test
U = 1031.5
p = 0.723
Interpretation
Both groups show near-zero average phase shift.
ISF differs from CNT by only ~0.2 hours (≈12 minutes).
Variation across mice far exceeds between-group differences.
No indication that 40 Hz stimulation shifts circadian phase.
Therefore, 40 Hz stimulation does not act as a zeitgeber under these conditions.
4. Effect Size Analysis
Cohen’s d for ΔAmplitude (POST–PRE)
d = 0.156
Interpretation
d ≈ 0.16 → negligible effect
Indicates that stimulation produces no meaningful biological change in circadian amplitude.
5. Multiple Comparisons (FDR Correction)
Interaction terms tested:
RA interaction
IV interaction
IS interaction
Barnes latency interaction
Raw p-values
RA: 0.699
IV: 0.191
IS: 0.958
Barnes latency: 0.343
FDR-adjusted p-values
[0.812, 0.689, 0.958, 0.689]
Interpretation
All effects remain non-significant after correction.
This confirms the robustness of the null results.
6. Barnes Maze Behavioural Results (for context)
Key Findings:
Mice learned the maze: Trial_num significantly reduced latency (p = 0.001)
Stimulation group did NOT differ in:
baseline latency (p = 0.705)
learning slope (Light × Trial interaction p = 0.343)
Interpretation
40 Hz stimulation does not alter spatial learning in the Barnes Maze.
7. Final Conclusions
Across all circadian metrics and behavioural assays:
 There is no statistical or biological evidence that 40 Hz gamma light stimulation alters circadian rhythms or Barnes Maze learning.
Specifically:
No changes in circadian amplitude, fragmentation, stability, or phase timing
No effect on baseline latency or learning rate
All interaction terms non-significant, even before FDR correction
Effect sizes are negligible (d ≈ 0.16)
Age, not stimulation, is the primary determinant of circadian strength
Overall Interpretation
Under the parameters tested, 40 Hz gamma light stimulation does not entrain, enhance, or disrupt circadian rhythms or spatial learning.
These results are consistent across all statistical models, circular analyses, and effect-size assessments.
